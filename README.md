# Random Color Box

This is a simple React component that displays a box whose background color changes randomly every second when you start it. You can toggle the color-changing animation with a button.

## Features

- Displays a colored box with a random RGB color.
- "Start/Stop Changing Color" button to control the color animation.
- Smooth and clean UI with minimal styling.
- Built using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).

## How it Works

- Initially, the box has a black background (`rgb(0, 0, 0)`).
- Clicking **Start Changing Color** begins an interval that changes the background to a new random color every second.
- Clicking **Stop Changing Color** clears the interval, freezing the current color.
